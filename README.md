Neural Gas Network (NGN) Toolbox - NGN Feature Selection - Supervised NGN (NGN Classifier) - NGN Data Augmentor 

The Neural Gas Network (NGN) is an artificial neural network algorithm introduced by Thomas Martinetz and Klaus Schulten in 1991, designed to perform vector quantization and clustering by adapting its structure to the data topology. Unlike the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which imposes a predefined grid structure, the NGN flexibly arranges its neurons in the data space based on a competitive learning process. Each neuron (or unit) in the NGN moves towards input data points, with the amount of movement influenced by both the distance to the data point and the rank order of the neuron. This process minimizes a cost function related to the distances between the neurons and the data points, effectively capturing the underlying distribution and structure of the data. The NGN is particularly useful for tasks requiring unsupervised learning, such as clustering, vector quantization, and dimensionality reduction, and it can be adapted for supervised learning tasks or synthetic data generation by incorporating class labels and specific update rules.

The Neural Gas Network (NGN) can be effectively utilized for feature selection by leveraging its ability to adaptively learn the underlying structure of high-dimensional data. During the training process, the NGN adjusts its neurons to minimize the distance to input data points, and the extent of these adjustments can be tracked to measure the influence of each feature. By analyzing the magnitude of changes in neuron positions relative to each feature, we can determine which features contribute most significantly to the data representation. This approach provides a way to rank and select the most informative features, thereby reducing dimensionality and improving the performance of subsequent machine learning models. Feature selection with NGN is particularly beneficial for datasets with many irrelevant or redundant features, as it helps in identifying and retaining only the most impactful features, leading to more efficient and effective learning.

The Supervised Neural Gas (SNG) classifier extends the original Neural Gas Network (NGN) by incorporating supervised learning principles to enable classification tasks. In the SNG classifier, neurons are initialized and updated not only based on their proximity to input data points but also considering the class labels of the data. During training, each neuron adapts its position in the feature space and its associated class label based on the input data points and their respective labels, resulting in a topology-preserving mapping that reflects both the data distribution and class separations. This supervised adaptation allows the SNG classifier to effectively distinguish between different classes in the data. After training, new data points are classified by identifying the nearest neuron and assigning its label to the input, leveraging the learned class-specific topologies. The SNG classifier is particularly useful for applications where maintaining the topological structure of the data while accurately classifying it is crucial, such as in pattern recognition, image classification, and anomaly detection.

The Neural Gas Network (NGN) can also be employed for synthetic data generation (SDG) by leveraging its ability to learn the distribution and topology of the input data through its adaptive neuron placement. Once trained, the NGN represents the data distribution with a set of neurons, each positioned to capture the essential characteristics of the input space. Synthetic data can be generated by sampling around these neurons, introducing controlled variations or noise to create new data points that mimic the properties of the original dataset. This approach ensures that the generated synthetic data maintains the same statistical properties and structural relationships as the real data. Using NGN for SDG is particularly valuable in scenarios where data augmentation is needed to enhance model training, address class imbalances, or simulate new scenarios for testing and validation. The flexibility and adaptability of NGN make it a powerful tool for generating high-quality synthetic data that can improve the robustness and generalization of machine learning models.
